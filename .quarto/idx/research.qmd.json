In this paper, we argue that elite asymmetries regarding the importance of CRT spillover to the electorate. We show that Republican legislators and conservative media’s use of the term “critical race theory” dwarfed that of Democratic legislators and liberal media, respectively. A spike in general interest in the term happened concurrently with this elite push. We then hypothesize that in part due to this asymmetry in exposure to the term “critical race theory” itself in elite messaging, CRT policy may have an asymmetric effect on political mobilization, favoring Republicans, who tend to oppose the teaching of CRT in schools. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a survey experiment and find that Republicans presented with a pro-CRT policy change are politically mobilized, while Democrats presented with an anti-CRT policy change are not. In particular, Republicans exposed to the pro-CRT policy reported a higher likelihood of voting, encouraging others to vote, and contacting their local politicians. Thus, the case of CRT helps to illustrate the conditions under which issues can asymmetrically mobilize citizens.\n\n<!-- Button to section syllabus to the right -->\n\n<button onclick=\"window.open(&#39;https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10516317&#39;, &#39;_blank&#39;);\" style=\"font-size: 1em; padding: 6px 12px; background-color: white; color: blue; border: 2px solid blue; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 10px; text-align: center; transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.backgroundColor=&#39;blue&#39;; this.style.color=&#39;white&#39;;\" onmouseout=\"this.style.backgroundColor=&#39;white&#39;; this.style.color=&#39;blue&#39;;\">read paper</button>\n\n<!-- Replication Code Button -->\n\n<button onclick=\"window.open(&#39;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/9QGIUH&#39;, &#39;_blank&#39;);\" style=\"font-size: 1em; padding: 6px 12px; background-color: black; color: yellow; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 10px; text-align: center; transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.backgroundColor=&#39;yellow&#39;; this.style.color=&#39;black&#39;;\" onmouseout=\"this.style.backgroundColor=&#39;black&#39;; this.style.color=&#39;yellow&#39;;\">replication code</button>\n\n<!-- BibTeX Citation with Background Color and Extra Space -->\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n\nTo cite this paper using BibTeX, use the following:\n\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; overflow-x: auto;\">\n\n``` bibtex\n@article{deshpande2024critical,\n  title={Critical race theory and asymmetric mobilization},\n  author={Deshpande, Pia and Blatte, Scott and Margalit,\n  Yonatan and Lezama, Carolina Olea and Schaffner, \n  Brian F and Shivakumar, Aadhya and Wingens, David},\n  journal={Political Behavior},\n  volume={46},\n  number={3},\n  pages={1677--1699},\n  year={2024},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n```\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n## Policy and Data Reports\n\nI do not include any of my writing as a journalist here (or my brief explainers for the MIT Election Lab — which you can handily read [here](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/475)).
